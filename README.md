Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification using Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, a commonly used dataset for identifying malignant vs. benign tumors based on various cell measurements.

ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

1. Dataset Selection

Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from sklearn.datasets.



2. Data Preprocessing

Performed train/test split.

Applied feature standardization using StandardScaler.



3. Model Building

Trained a Logistic Regression model on the scaled training data.



4. Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Precision

Recall

ROC-AUC Score




5. Threshold Tuning and Sigmoid Explanation

Tuned the classification threshold to optimize model performance.

Explained the working of the sigmoid function used in Logistic Regression to convert linear scores into probabilities.




ðŸ“Š Libraries Used

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, metrics, datasets, etc.)

matplotlib / seaborn (optional for visualizations)


ðŸ’¡ Concepts Covered

Logistic Regression

Binary Classification

Feature Scaling

Evaluation Metrics for Classification

Probability Threshold Tuning

Sigmoid Activation Function
